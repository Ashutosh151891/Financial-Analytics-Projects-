This project contains files from R studio and MS Excel that shows Portfolio Analysis using Markowitz method for two different portfolios where R studio is used for quick and accurate calculation for Sharpe Ratio, Minimum variance, and Maximum variance. This process will help the investor to know the minimum risk which he has to take to get the maximum returns (Markowitz Method). These R codes also help to find out the returns and standard deviation of the portfolio. 
This the portfolio can be changed by just changing the stock tickers name mentioned in the initial stage of the code.

Candlestick Body: This represents the range between the opening and closing prices of the asset for that period. If the closing price is higher than the opening price, the body is typically colored or filled (often green or white).

Random Walk model for ICICIBANK.NS 
This project analyzes the historical daily closing prices of ICICI Bank (icicibank.ns) using a Random Walk model to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was conducted to check stationarity, followed by first-order differencing to ensure suitability for modeling. Results indicated that the stock prices exhibit characteristics of a Random Walk, with residuals resembling white noise, supporting the unpredictability of future prices based on past trends. Visualizations include actual vs. predicted prices and residual diagnostics, highlighting the model's high uncertainty in forecasting.
