This project contains files from R studio and MS Excel that shows Portfolio Analysis using Markowitz method for two different portfolios where R studio is used for quick and accurate calculation for Sharpe Ratio, Minimum variance, and Maximum variance. This process will help the investor to know the minimum risk which he has to take to get the maximum returns (Markowitz Method). These R codes also help to find out the returns and standard deviation of the portfolio. 
This the portfolio can be changed by just changing the stock tickers name mentioned in the initial stage of the code.
